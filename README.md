## Use

The module is a fuction which you pass a array of objects, each object must have the following properties:

* "name": Exchange ID defined in ccxt module, [click](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Exchange-Markets-By-Country) to see the exchanges avaible and their IDÂ´s.
* "period": Time to wait before make another REST request to the exchange (milliseconds).
* "checkers": Array of objects which you use to define conditions to check, below you will find an explanation to this.
* "error": Error handler, when the request could not work you receive an error here. So you can decide what to do, and **if you want to still making request you execute "this.getTickers()"**.

The properties of a checker object is the following:

* "name": This name is to identify the condition used to check in the data received in "do" method, because you can have an array of them.
* "condition": Condition to check against the tickers - You receive two tickers (last and current) to check.
* "update": Function to decide which ticker must be the last - You receive two tickers (last and current) to decide.
* "do": You receive here the tickers who accomplish the condition.

To check if the market accomplish a condition you need two tickers. Usually lastTicker is taken in a previous time than currentTicker, but you can decide which must be the lastTicker in a update method. **In every ticker you receive the information of all markets in the exchange**. In the ccxt [documentation](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Manual#api-methods--endpoints) you can see how it is strutured the tickers and how it works on the exchange, the method used is "fetchTickers".
